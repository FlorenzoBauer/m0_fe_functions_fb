# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
1. I am proud of getting through it, I tried a few different ways for most of the problems and kept the one I like or felt like was simplest and best. I thought the instructions on some, like the checkStock function was a bit confusing but overall I think I did and performed well. 
2. I think functions are incredible powerful, its like mini applications stored inside of the application you are using, great for saving time and doing repetitive tasks in a much simpler way than coding the same actions over, I think the only thing more powerful would be a loop.
